- 👋 Hi, I’m @evanatzend
- 👀 I’m interested in backend technologies, although I pride myself on my competence in a broad array of fields.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... flask and django
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing really 
- 📫 How to reach me ... u/frondred on reddit and redtemi@icloud.com
- most of my repos will remain private as this is a new account created for corporate collaborations. I hope to get along with everyone.
